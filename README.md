Key Insights:
Amazon's biggest sales come from Asia Pacific and the US/Canada regions. These are their strongest markets. Most of Amazon's sales are from products sold to individual consumers, rather than businesses or offices. Some Amazon products make a lot of profit, while others don't make much profit at all. There's a big difference in how profitable different products are. The map shows that Amazon sells a lot in North America and Europe, but there are opportunities to grow sales in other parts of the world.
Recommendations:
Market Expansion: Amazon should invest more in advertising and building better delivery systems in Asia Pacific and the US/Canada. These are their strongest markets with lots of potential customers. Focus on Consumer Products: Given the significant contribution of the Consumer segment, Amazon should focus on enhancing its consumer offerings, improving customer experience, and exploring new product lines or services tailored to consumer needs.
Review Product Profits: Amazon should carefully look at why some products make a lot of profit while others don't. They may need to adjust prices, improve delivery, or change which products they sell to make more money.
Sell in New Countries: While continuing to sell in their current big markets, Amazon should also look for new countries with lots of potential customers. They may need to adapt their products and marketing for these new markets.
Use Data to Make Decisions: Amazon should use the interactive dashboard to constantly check sales numbers, customer preferences, and market trends. This will help them make good decisions and quickly adapt their strategies as things change.
By following these recommendations, Amazon can strengthen its position as a leader, make more money from its products, and find new opportunities for growth while maintaining a customer-centric approach.
